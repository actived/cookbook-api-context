# Cookbook example projects

This is a cookbook example to show you how to access and interact with a state with a context, by comparing a project not using the context api and the same project but with the use of the context api.

We will find two almost identical projects, one without context and one with the use of the context api.

All this is done in order to give an answer to the question:
> How can I interact with a state between multiple components whitout having to down it into the props of each components that needs it ?

# How to run projects ?
In first step you need to have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/).

For first example without context api you just need to do:

    cd 01-without-context-api
    npm install
    npm start

For second example with context API:

    cd 02-with-context-api
    npm install
    npm start
